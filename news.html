    The 93rd Academy Awards ceremony, presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), will honor the best films released between January 1, 2020, and February 28, 2021. It is scheduled to take place at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, on April 25, 2021, two months later than originally planned, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema. The nominations are scheduled to be announced on March 15, 2021.

    The Academy announced in June 2020 that it was postponing the ceremony from its originally scheduled date of February 28, 2021, to April 25 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema, thereby extending the eligibility period for feature films through to February 28, 2021. The eligibility criteria had already been modified to account for films originally intended to have a theatrical release but which were ultimately released directly to video.

    Shortlists for nine Oscar categories have been unveiled by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Ampas), an intermediate stage in the thinning-out of films that have qualified for consideration for the Academy Awards. The categories include best documentary, best international film and best song, as well as best live action and documentary shorts.

    For the past two years, Hollywoodâ€™s biggest awards show has gone without a host. And without a hitch. Under normal circumstances, the third time might be a charm once again. But the coronavirus pandemic has changed everything.
    <br>
    <br>
     While the 93rd Academy Awards show will go on (on Sunday, April 25) the time might be right to bring back a proper emcee. Someone to engage the audience. Someone to nurture the nominees. And someone to wow the world as the Oscars show why it truly is the greatest awards show on earth.
